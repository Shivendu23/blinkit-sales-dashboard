# Blinkit Item Type Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales performance across different item types for Blinkit, a quick commerce company. The dashboard provides insights into which item categories are driving the most revenue, the average sales per item type, and the variety of products offered within each category. This analysis aims to help Blinkit understand its sales patterns, optimize product offerings, and make informed business decisions to maximize revenue.

## Data Source

The data for this project was obtained from a dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset contains sales information for various items across different Blinkit outlets. The key columns used in this analysis include:

* `Item_Identifier`: Unique identifier for each product.
* `Item_Type`: The category to which the product belongs (e.g., "Fruits and Vegetables," "Snack Foods").
* `Item_Outlet_Sales`: The sales revenue generated by the item at a specific outlet.
* `Item_MRP`: Maximum Retail Price of the item.
* `Item_Visibility`: The display area allocated to the products in a store.
* `Item_Fat_Content`: Whether the item is low fat or regular.
* `Item_Weight`: Weight of the item.
* `Outlet_Identifier`: Unique identifier for each outlet.
* `Outlet_Size`: The size of the outlet (e.g., "Small," "Medium," "Large").
* `Outlet_Location_Type`: The type of location where the outlet is situated (e.g., "Tier 1," "Tier 2," "Tier 3").
* `Outlet_Type`: The type of outlet (e.g., "Grocery Store," "Supermarket Type1").
* `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: The year in which the outlet was established.

## Methodology

The project was executed using Microsoft Power BI. The following steps were involved:

1.  Data Import and Cleaning: The dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop. Initial data inspection revealed that the data was relatively clean, but missing values and inconsistencies were checked.
2.  Data Modeling: The dataset was structured appropriately for analysis within Power BI.
3.  DAX Measures: Several DAX measures were created to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and enable insightful visualizations.
4.  Dashboard Design: A user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard was designed to present the findings.
5.  Visualization and Interactivity: Charts, tables, and slicers were used to provide a comprehensive and interactive view of the data.

## DAX Measures

The following DAX measures were created to perform the necessary calculations:

* `Total Sales All Items`: This measure calculates the total sales across all item types.

    ```dax
    Total Sales All Items =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('Blinkit table'[Item_Outlet_Sales]),
        ALL('Blinkit table')
    )
    ```

    * Logic: The `CALCULATE` function is used to override any existing filters on the table, ensuring that the `SUM` function calculates the total sales for all items, regardless of any selections made in the dashboard.  The `ALL` function removes all filters from the 'Blinkit table'.
    * Purpose: This measure provides a constant value for the total sales, which is used as the denominator in the percentage calculation.

* `Average Sales per Item Type`: This measure calculates the average sales for each item type.

    ```dax
    Average Sales per Item Type = AVERAGE('Blinkit table'[Item_Outlet_Sales])
    ```

    * Logic: The `AVERAGE` function calculates the average of the `Item_Outlet_Sales` column for each item type, as grouped by the visual.
    * Purpose: This measure helps in understanding the average revenue generated by each item within a category, providing insights into pricing and sales performance.

* `Distinct Item Count by Type`: This measure counts the number of distinct items within each item type.

    ```dax
    Distinct Item Count by Type = DISTINCTCOUNT('Blinkit table'[Item_Identifier])
    ```

    * Logic: The `DISTINCTCOUNT` function counts the number of unique `Item_Identifier` values for each item type.
    * Purpose: This measure shows the variety of products offered within each item category, indicating the breadth of the product range.

* `Percentage of Total Sales by Item Type`: This measure calculates the percentage contribution of each item type to the total sales.

    ```dax
    Percentage of Total Sales by Item Type =
    DIVIDE(
        SUM('Blinkit table'[Item_Outlet_Sales]),
        [Total Sales All Items]
    )
    ```

    * Logic: The `SUM` function calculates the total sales for the current item type (in the context of the visual), and the `DIVIDE` function divides this by the `Total Sales All Items` measure (the total sales across all item types) to get the percentage.  The DIVIDE function handles cases where the denominator might be zero.
    * Purpose: This measure highlights the relative contribution of each item type to the overall revenue, making it easy to identify the key revenue drivers.

## Dashboard Design

The dashboard is designed to provide a clear and concise overview of item type sales performance. The following design principles were followed:

* Layout: A top-down layout is used, starting with overall KPIs and then drilling down into detailed visualizations.
* Color Palette: A consistent and professional color palette (blue and grey) is used for a cohesive look.
* Visual Hierarchy: Key metrics and visualizations are given prominence through size and placement.
* Interactivity: Slicers are used to allow users to filter the data and explore specific segments.
* Clarity: Clear titles, labels, and tooltips are used to ensure easy understanding.

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

* Total Sales and Total Distinct Items (Cards): These KPIs provide a quick overview of the overall sales performance and the total product variety.
* Percentage of Total Sales by Item Type (Horizontal Bar Chart): This chart visually compares the contribution of each item type to the total revenue, making it easy to identify the top-performing categories.
* Total Sales by Item Type (Column Chart): This chart shows the absolute sales value for each item type, complementing the percentage chart.
* Average Sales per Item Type (Line Chart): This chart displays the average sales per item type, providing insights into pricing and profitability.
* Distinct Item Count by Type (Horizontal Bar Chart): This chart displays the number of unique items within each item type.
* Slicers: Slicers for `Item_Fat_Content`, `Item_Type`, `Outlet_Identifier`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Type`, and `Outlet_Location_Type` allow users to filter the data and analyze specific subsets.
* Detailed Table: A table at the bottom of the dashboard provides a detailed view of the data, including all the calculated measures.

## Key Insights

The dashboard reveals the following key insights:

* Top Revenue Drivers: "Fruits and Vegetables" and "Snack Foods" are the top revenue-generating item types, contributing the most to the overall sales.
* High Variety, High Sales: Categories with a high number of distinct items, such as "Fruits and Vegetables" and "Snack Foods," tend to have higher overall sales.
* High Value, Lower Volume: Some categories, like "Seafood," have a high average sales per item but contribute less to the total sales due to a smaller product variety and lower sales volume.
* Outlet Performance Variation: Sales performance varies across different outlet locations and types.
* Impact of Item Visibility and MRP: Item visibility and MRP impacts the sales.

## Potential Next Steps

* Further Outlet Analysis: A deeper analysis of outlet performance, including factors like outlet size, location, and type, could provide valuable insights into optimizing outlet strategy.
* Profitability Analysis: If cost data were available, a profitability analysis could be conducted to determine the most profitable item types and outlets.
* Time-Series Analysis: If historical sales data were available, a time-series analysis could be performed to identify trends and seasonality in sales patterns.
* Customer Segmentation: If customer data were available, the company could segment its customers and analyze their purchasing behavior to tailor product offerings and marketing efforts.

## Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of item type sales performance for Blinkit. The insights generated from this analysis can help Blinkit make data-driven decisions to optimize its product strategy, improve sales performance, and maximize revenue.
